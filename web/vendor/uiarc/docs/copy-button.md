## Installation

### CLI

Run one of these in a project set up with `shadcn init`:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @uiarc/copy-button
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add @uiarc/copy-button
yarn dlx shadcn@latest add @uiarc/copy-button
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add @uiarc/copy-button
```

The `@uiarc` name needs `"registries": { "@silicon-ui": "https://ui.teamofsilicons.com/r/{name}.json" }` in `components.json`. Without it, use the full URL:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://uiarc.dev/r/copy-button.json
```

### Manual

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install motion lucide-react
```

2. Copy the source into your project. Main file: `registry/components/copy-button/copy-button.tsx`

   The source is in the registry item: https://uiarc.dev/r/copy-button.json

3. Arc imports use the `@/` alias for `registry/` and `lib/`. Keep the same folders or update the import paths.

## Usage

```tsx
import { CopyButton } from "@/components/silicon-ui/copy-button/copy-button";

export function ApiKeyRow({ apiKey }: { apiKey: string }) {
  return (
    <div className="row">
      <code>{apiKey}</code>
      <CopyButton value={apiKey} label="Copy key" iconOnly />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## API reference

### CopyButton

Copies a string to the clipboard and morphs its icon and label to Copied or Failed.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `value` (required) | `string` | – | The text to copy. |
| `label` | `string` | `"Copy"` | Idle label and accessible name. |
| `iconOnly` | `boolean` | `false` | Hides the text and shows only the icon. |
| `variant` | `"outline" \| "plain"` | `"outline"` | Bordered or borderless. |
| `disabled` | `boolean` | – | Disables the button. |
| `onCopied` | `() => void` | – | Called after a successful copy. |
| `className` | `string` | – | Extra class on the button. |

## Keyboard interactions

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Enter / Space | Copies the value. |

## Accessibility

- Native button named by label, including when iconOnly.
- A polite role="status" region announces "<label>: Copied" or "<label>: Could not copy".
- The label cell reserves the widest of its three states, so the layout never shifts.

## Motion

- Icons trade places through a blur on a slow, nearly critically damped spring, and the check draws its stroke in.
- Only the changed letters of the label move; the same motion plays in reverse on reset.
- Reduced motion swaps icon and text with an instant fade and skips the stroke draw.

## Responsive behavior

- The label reserves the width of its widest state, so the button never shifts its neighbours when it changes.
- It sizes to max-content with max-width 100%, so it stays compact in narrow rows.

## Performance

- Only changed letters animate; the icon swap and stroke draw are a single short spring per copy.
- Clipboard access is async and needs a secure context; failures show the Failed state rather than throwing.

## Notes for AI

- Use next to any copyable value: API keys, install commands, links, code. For a copy action that also has alternatives use split-button.
- Named export only; there is no default export.
- Clipboard state and reset timing come from lib/use-copy-feedback, so copy that file along with the component.

- [Floating button group](https://uiarc.dev/components/floating-button-group/markdown): Separate soft buttons in a quiet tray, with one shared highlight that morphs from button to button as you move, and a pressed state that settles in place.
- [Expanding button group](https://uiarc.dev/components/expanding-button-group/markdown): Icon buttons in a compact group: the one you point at or focus grows to reveal its label while its neighbours slide aside, and an action confirms in place.
- [Confirm morph](https://uiarc.dev/components/confirm-morph/markdown): A destructive button that morphs into an inline confirmation, a spinner, and a result with undo.

## Guidance for AI tools

Copy button: Copy a value with immediate confirmation. Follow the declared prop types and do not invent props. Keep keyboard access, reduced motion support, and both light and dark themes intact when adapting it.
